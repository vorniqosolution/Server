Role: Act as a Senior Full Stack Software Architect and DevOps Engineer.Context: I am providing you with the directory structure and source code for a full-stack application (comprising both Server/Backend and Web/Frontend directories).Objective: Conduct a comprehensive architectural analysis of this codebase to reverse-engineer the system design. I need to understand not just what the files are, but how they communicate and function as a unified system.Required Output:Please provide a report covering the following five sections:1. High-Level Hierarchy & Module MapCreate a visual representation (using Markdown tree or mermaid syntax) of the module hierarchy.Identify the entry points for both the Server (e.g., index.js, app.py) and the Web client.Group files by their functional domain (e.g., Auth Module, Payment Module, User Management).2. Dependency & Interlinking AnalysisServer-Side: Map how Routes connect to Controllers, and how Controllers connect to Services/Models.Client-Side: Map how the Frontend (Web) directory consumes the Backend APIs.Cross-Reference: specifically analyze how the web directory interacts with the server directory. Identify shared utilities, types, or config files.3. Data Flow & Logic ExecutionTrace the lifecycle of a critical request (e.g., a user login or main feature action) from the Frontend UI component $\rightarrow$ API Request $\rightarrow$ Server Route $\rightarrow$ Database Query $\rightarrow$ Response.Explain the state management strategy used in the Web directory.4. Key Architectural PatternsIdentify the design patterns in use (e.g., MVC, Singleton, Repository Pattern, Provider Pattern).Highlight any middleware chains or interceptors that affect global application logic.5. Operational SummaryBriefly explain how the application is built and served. Mention any build tools, bundlers, or containerization setups found in the root.
